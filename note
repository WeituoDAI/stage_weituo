1.EBM: Explainable Boosting Machine (Nori, et al. 2019; Lou, et al. 2013)
use generated additive model, and add the part of bi-interaction


2.GAMI-Net: Generalized Additive Model with Structured Interactions (Yang, Zhang and Sudjianto, 2021)
https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07132
use generated additive model(each part is a subnetwork), and add the part of bi-interaction,
and use the feature selection(choose the most important features)


3.ReLU-DNN: Deep ReLU Networks using Aletheia Unwrapper and Sparsification (Sudjianto, et al. 2020)
https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.04041#
use ReLU activation function in the deep neural network.
Unwrapping:
	we partition all input data into several segments (depend on if the instance satisfies some ReLU functions or not)
	in each segment, the model is in fact linear, thus more interpretable.
